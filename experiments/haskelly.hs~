Some sample things to try and make ...

-------------------------------

Single Well

Cell Modem Polled Well Set

Elynx Well Definition

GCS Well

Schlumberger Well

------------------------------

I think having a setting like default Maybe makes a lot of sense.

* If DefaultOptional is turned on, then every field is actually assumed to be optional
  I think it also makes sense to make this the default.

  * So you would specify 'NoDefaultOptional' to turn it off

  * perhaps even a UseOptionalMaybe, UserOptionalEither or something like that in the future


* Stealing the typeclasses on Value in Data.Aeson leads me to some interesting stuff
   Eq Value	 
   Data Value	 
   Show Value	 
   Typeable Value	 
   IsString Value	 
   NFData Value	 
   Hashable Value
